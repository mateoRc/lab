# Event Catalog

Vaultsh and Atlas send best-effort telemetry events to Forge over HTTP. Events
are queued temporarily in each producer's memory and delivered by a background
worker using `POST /events`.

Forge requires `Authorization: Bearer <FORGE_AUTH_TOKEN>` for event ingestion
and metrics reads. Its health and status probes are intentionally
unauthenticated inside the Compose network.

## Event Schema

```json
{
  "service": "vault",
  "event": "command.executed",
  "name": "grep",
  "duration_ms": 8,
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

Fields:

- `service` — event producer.
- `event` — event type.
- `name` — command or operation.
- `duration_ms` — execution duration in milliseconds.
- `exit_code` — `0` for success; non-zero values count as errors.

String fields accept only letters, numbers, `.`, `_`, and `-`. Their maximum
lengths are 64 characters for `service` and 128 for `event` and `name`.
`duration_ms` is limited to `0`–`86400000`; `exit_code` is limited to
`0`–`255`. Unknown fields are rejected.

## Vaultsh Events

### `command.executed`

Emitted after every Vaultsh command execution.

```json
{
  "service": "vault",
  "event": "command.executed",
  "name": "search",
  "duration_ms": 12,
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

`name` contains the first command in the submitted command line, including
built-ins such as `cat`, `grep`, `ls`, `search`, `metrics`, `dashboard`,
`contact`, and `welcome`.

## Atlas Events

### `search.executed`

Emitted after every valid Atlas search request.

```json
{
  "service": "atlas",
  "event": "search.executed",
  "name": "search",
  "duration_ms": 4,
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

Blank or missing queries rejected before search execution do not emit an
event. Search failures use a non-zero exit code.

## Forge Storage

Forge stores validated events in SQLite with a server-generated UTC timestamp.
Stored fields are limited to service, event, name, duration, and exit code.
Unknown fields are rejected; IPs, tokens, request bodies, and command arguments
are not accepted.

Summaries are rebuilt from retained events for the requested activity window:
`hours=24`, `hours=168`, or `hours=720`. The default is 24 hours. Summaries
include request and error totals, average, p50, and p95 backend command time,
plus counts by service and operation. Retention and database-size limits delete
the oldest rows. Storage metadata covers all retained rows, independent of the
selected activity window; `oldest retained` is the oldest row still present in
SQLite, not an all-time project history marker.

## Delivery Guarantees

- Producer queues hold at most 1,000 events by default.
- Enqueueing does not block application requests.
- Events are dropped if a producer queue is full.
- Events may be lost while queued by a producer or during delivery.
- Forge persists accepted events, but there are no durable producer
  acknowledgements, retries, or cross-producer ordering guarantees.
- Telemetry delivery failures never fail Vaultsh commands or Atlas searches.

This best-effort model is intentional for the MVP.
